This is a raspberry project that controls christmas tree lights and creates a "light show" by reading a premade sequence (further on that later - the program is called VixenLights) and turns on the right switches. Maybe one day I'll have time to sketch the actual wiring. It also runs a flask server which hosts a local website to choose which song to play, upload a new one or edit the songs if you have admin rights and users can add a new suggestion they would like to see on the playlist.
